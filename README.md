# Sinatra React Project: Creative Minds


## Introduction


This project is separated into two applications:

- A React frontend, in the `creative-mind-client` directory
- A Sinatra backend, in the `creative-mind-server` directory


## Frontend Setup

To get started, `cd` into the `creative-mind-client` directory. Then run:

```console
$ npm install
$ npm run server
```

This will install the React project dependencies, and run a API server
using `json-server`. Next, run this in a new terminal:

```console
$ npm start
```

Then visit [http://localhost:9292](http://localhost:9292) in the browser and
interact with the application to get a sense of its features.


## Backend Setup

In another terminal, `cd` into the `creative-mind-server` directory, and run
`bundle install` to install the dependencies.
